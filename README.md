# FirstMobileApp
My first ameteur  mobile app to see how android ui and serverside calls work.
This app basically makes 3 API calls:
First one for retriving game list,
Second one for taking details of selected game item,
Third one for every searched string it makes a new api call for getting relative games.
Both sync and async calls have been utilized.
